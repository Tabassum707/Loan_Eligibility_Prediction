# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction
A project using different Machine Learning Models.
Dataset was collected from Kaggle.
- Prediction on bank customer loan eligibility based on key attributes.
- Involved dataset needed cleaning due to imbalances and missing values.
- Applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM to train and test dataset.
- The performance of each classifier was evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, cross-validation, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and area
under the ROC curve.
